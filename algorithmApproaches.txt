algorithm approach #1
- generate a 10 song recommendation per request
- pool the songs together
- randomly add songs to playlist

if 80% of the party selects rap as their favorite genre, 80% of the songs that get played will be rap music.


algorithm approach #2
- have pool of artists
- have pool of genres
- whenever someone joins the party, push their request (artists & genres) to the pool
- whenever someone joins or a song ends, generate a song from five randomly selected artists & genres from pools
